# AutoShutdown-Enhanced
A simple GUI application that tracks network traffic and disk read/write speeds to check if you are still downloading/copying something. After your download/copy finished, your PC will shutdown automatically. It's designed for places with a slow internet connection. Users can download huge files/games over night, while not wasting any power.
